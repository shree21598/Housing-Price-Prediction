#Data Exploration

The dataset includes a wide range of information about the residential homes, such as the number of bedrooms, the area of the property, the quality of materials used, and many other factors. These attributes are used to analyze and understand the relationship between the features and the sale prices of the houses.

#Discussion of Findings

The dataset consists of various attributes that influence the pricing of residential homes. All of the ten selected attributes have a positive correlation with the target attribute "SalePrice," indicating that they increase or decrease in parallel with changes in the sale price.

Among these attributes, "OverallQual" has the most significant impact on the sale price, while "YearRemodAdd" has the least impact compared to others. The scatterplots demonstrate the relationships between these attributes and the sale prices, providing insights into how these factors affect the housing market.
